                I would say that being a part of The Royal Academy was life changing for me. The academy has helped me bring my longtime passion for technology and creativity to reality. I have been given many opportunities to enhance learning. Not only did I find my passion but I also got to experience learning through an effective journey in the Emotional, Physical, Social and Spiritual Areas of Development despite the fact that I was exposed to only a cerebral environment in my previous school.

                I come from a family that takes rigour very seriously, which almost makes it seem like it is part of my genes..

He said that though he had difficulties and disturbance during the time of contemplation and study, he never made those factors hinder his goal. At home, I remember how he guided me through this path of rigor.

          <p class="para">I am very lucky to have been introduced to computer programming at a very young age at The Royal Academy. The introduction to programming was when my Computer Science teacher taught us about the Scratch 2 programme. This interested me to explore more because I felt like it was something worth doing. I have committed myself to enhance my level of programming skills to achieve my dream of becoming a pre degree software engineer. Over the last few years, I have managed to acquire basics and intermediate level of programming based on theories. But I came to realize that, to enhance my experience and knowledge further I had to do more practical learning experiences. Therefore I feel confident, but at the same time a need for me to become a pre degree software engineer. Moreover, I have learnt programming under my own initiative and I took ownership of my own learning. This makes me confident to become a software engineer. Till date, I have been able to learn three programming languages and have done seven projects to hone my skills. I realized the science or the art of machines and how they function is the field that I am passionate about. I remember how I went crazy spending 16 hours a day in front of a screen learning until I was satisfied.

                My first nature retreat was to the base camp of Mt.Jomolhari, and it was indeed  a rigorous but at same time joyful experience where I made some special  memories of. My curiosity for learning helped me connect with nature more deeply. I remember being curious about  plants and birds in nature and it was with this thought that I approached the forest ranger who accompanied us, asking him questions about what I saw.. The moment the curiosity was fulfilled, it gave me a sense of satisfaction.

Seven gifts is one of the big projects at Academy, which reflects the diversity of Bhutan and curates examples of this diversity and to help build a stronger foundation. At that time I had good skills and knowledge on navigating Adobe Photoshop so I volunteered  myself to the teacher and offered to work on it.

Likewise, my friends have approached me for help in understanding the programming language, I helped all of them understand the concept more by using simpler terms. There were several occasions where our school needed a better system for certain things, such as  a proper waste disposal area and we decided that we were going to build that. Though it was Sunday, I made an effort to volunteer and work on it. It was not a required project  for me but I seized the opportunity to  learn new skills.

Moreover, I have watched several videos on youtube space to know more about the universe. After I worked with project PANOPTES my knowledge on space science enlightened more and even got a chance to to talk about the Project PANOPTES and what it does in a space seminar in Bhutan Space Week.

                          <h2>2016</h2>
                          <p>The year 2016 embarked with my journey into the academy. I was received gracefully by the faculty members at the academy. I was sort of excited during my first year, because I was curious to learn more and the fact that I used to hate my boarding school which I spent two weeks in. When I came in I had confidence in self and confidence to stand up in front of a crowd, but I would consider myself as an attention seeker back then. But gradually through five areas and feedback from the teachers and peers I started to work on getting along with my community more positively. 

                            That year was also the year where I encountered my passion, programming. It was in a computer science class when our teacher introduced us to this programme called scratch. From that day on I started working on learning and taking ownership of developing mastery in programming. Which I now feel that I have come so far compared back then. Along with programming my interest towards visual arts such as movie making started off. I remember making a musical video which I call the pioneer at academy in starting movie making.

                          <h2>2017</h2>
                          <p>That year, my love for science and the desire and curiosity to learn more embarked as I started watching science videos and reading articles which really fascinated me. In that year I started developing my emotional endurance of being open minded. Furthermore, with my roadmaps and feedback loop from teachers I started to work on developing rigor in anything I do. One thing I noticed at that point of time was that I was lacking patience which in turn ruined everything. So rigor helped me to endure patience and do the things slowly and at the best of my ability.

                            My journey of movie making didn’t end at that point of time, it went on where me and a group of my friends made our first movie. And it was one of the big achievements of our learning journey. Then after that movie I worked with another team of friends to come up with a comedy movie which we completed in three weeks.

                          <h2>2018</h2>
                          <p>2018 was a life changing year for me, I started to grow physically and mentally. I started to mature in thoughts and concentration. My passion started to perceive more focus and my learning was growing. I started developing my passion and things started making more sense as I started to grow and mature more. There were lots of eureka moments where I realized and understood something which I didn’t know earlier. 

                            With my interest in learning movie making I got the chance to participate for a multimedia competition hosted by vasant valley school. I realized the power of socializing with more people and working together.

                          <h2>2019</h2>
                          <p>It was the year where I was occupied with opportunities which were relevant to my passion. It all started with the national STEM olympiad where I got the opportunity to design, build and lead a team in coming up with a robot for robotics competition at Mongar. We stood fourth position during the competition and we got to learn holistically. It required a lot of emotional endurance as anyone could lose patience while building a robot for the first time. And our communications and our working towards common goals required a strong bond to come to a better result. There were tassels amongst the team but from that we learnt more and beyond our classroom. During that time multitasking was one important aspect in our life as we had to catch up with our friends in learning experiences and we also had to do all those normal things.

                            After that I got this wonderful experience of being part of Project PANOPTES and learning from the astronomers. This project further helped me cross pollinate across domains and my learning further extended. Seeing the night sky through the telescope was a dream come true for. I feel really privileged to have such an opportunity to learn.
